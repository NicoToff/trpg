# Introduction to Mothership Game 2

We awake from cryosleep to the sound of an alarm. The ship has lost its course, we aren't where we're supposed to be. We are in an unexplored area of the Outer Rim.

The AI says: "Major fuel leakage! Three hours remain before we run out of fuel. Jump drive is disabled."

We realise there is a malware in the ship's computer.

## First scene: The mothership

- [ ] Fix the fuel leak
- [ ] Fix the jump drive
- [ ] Find more fuel â›½
- [ ] Find help

### What we do

- We realise there is a spaceship closeby, The Alexis. We send a distress signal, but they don't respond. We decide to go there and ask for help. The Alexis is obviously still working, it is not abandonned.
- We visit the area in our ship with the leakage. We find drugs in the ship's boot...

## Second scene: The Alexis

- [ ] Enter the Alexis

### What we do

- We enter the Alexis via a docking station. The ship is dark and silent. The ship's AI is offline.
- We are attacked by a hive of acid-spitting aliens with tentacles. We kill some, but ultimately we are forced to flee.
- We locate the source of a weird energy, it's in the cargo bay.
- Carlton tries to use his blowtorch to open the door to the engine room, but it doesn't work. The lights darken and a inhumane shout is heard.
- In a small room, we find a dead crew member, killed by the aliens we found earlier. He holds a note in his hand. The note says: "I'm the unfathomable silence". Most importantly, we find a **_KEYCARD_** in this room!

## Third scene: A Dangerous Encounter

- [ ] Explore the Alexis further

### What we do

- Strange screams continue. Carlton shits his pants. We find a horse-sized creature, with a huge mouth and a thousand teeth. We all shit our pants. ðŸ‘¾
- We battle the alien valiantly, but Tom Tomson is badly hurt after thrusting his boarding axe into the creature. Tom loses **off-hand** ðŸ˜±.
- We flee and Samantha tends Tom's wound.
