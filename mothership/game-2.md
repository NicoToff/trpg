# Introduction to Mothership Game 2

We awake from cryosleep to the sound of an alarm. The ship has lost its course, we aren't where we're supposed to be. We are in an unexplored area of the Outer Rim.

The AI says: "Major fuel leakage! Three hours remain before we run out of fuel. Jump drive is disabled."

We realise there is a malware in the ship's computer.

## First scene: The mothership

- [] Fix the fuel leak
- [] Fix the jump drive
- [] Find more fuel â›½
- [] Find help

### What we do

- We realise there is a spaceship closeby, The Alexis. We send a distress signal, but they don't respond. We decide to go there and ask for help. The Alexis is obviously still working, it is not abandonned.
- We visit the area in our ship with the leakage. We find drugs in the ship's boot...

## Second scene: The Alexis

- [] Enter the Alexis

### What we do

- We enter the Alexis via a docking station. The ship is dark and silent. The ship's AI is offline.
- We are attacked by a hive of acid-spitting aliens with tentacles. We kill some, but ultimately we are forced to flee.
- We locate the source of a weird energy, it's in the cargo bay.
- Carlton tries to use his blowtorch to open the door to the engine room, but it doesn't work. The lights darken and a inhumane shout is heard.
- In a small room, we find a dead crew member, killed by the aliens we found earlier. He holds a note in his hand. The note says: "I'm the unfathomable silence". Most importantly, we find a **_KEYCARD_** in this room!

## Third scene: A Dangerous Encounter

- [] Explore the Alexis further

### What we do

- Strange screams continue. Carlton shits his pants. We find a horse-sized creature, with a huge mouth and a thousand teeth. We all shit our pants. ðŸ‘¾
- We battle the alien valiantly, but Tom Tomson is badly hurt after thrusting his boarding axe into the creature. Tom loses **off-hand** ðŸ˜±.
- We flee and Samantha tends Tom's wound.

## Fourth scene: The Captain's Quarters

- [] Explore the room

### What we do

- We find a personal notebook, _Battles of Sector Delta_ and _The Ghost of Sheckletown_.
- The notebook tells about an artefact found on a moon somewhere else. They brought is aboard the ship and the captain mentions he's having nightmares since then.

## Fifth scene: Exploration continues

- [] Explore the rest of the ship

### What we do

In the common room, we meet two confused androids. They twitch violently, one is actually cut in half... They seem to be filling a personnality test on a computer.

```
Android 1: Nothing makes sense. My friend is cut in half! The main computer is not answering.
Team: We advise you to factory reboot the ship, then soft reboot yourselves.
```

They seem to have lost all memory before about 30 minutes ago.

- We find two human corpses in the common room. One of them is missing a leg, forcibly pulled away. The other one has bits of bones on him.
