# Introduction to Mothership Game 3

We've just failed a space jump. We are crashing towards the red moon because a space harpoon was shot at our ship. There's a huge bunker and dozens of other crashed ships on that moon.

> ### _Characters_
> - Carlton "Cortex" Ortega, the captain
> - Samanta Carter, a medic
> - Karla Von LinnÃ©, a biologist
> - Tom Tomson, a one-handed marine

## First scene: The crash

The whole group gathers in the cockpit room. Tom is feverish and just had a nightmare. He is in a bad shape, but Samanta Carter tries to help him.

Carlton seals all the doors, but the ship is breached on the oxigen purifier and larder. The damage is substantial, but repairable within a few weeks, if they can get the parts.

This harpooning technique is new to Carlton, he has no idea who or what could have done this.

### Tasks

- [ ] Fix the oxigen purifier (priority)
- [ ] Fix the larder room

## What we do

Karla fetches everything we need for the expedition. 

The whole group leaves the Mothership to find parts for the oxigen purifier.

A large humanoid in a vacc suit approaches us. He carries the bust of a broken android on his back. They wave at us. Tom waves back with his flamethrower. 

> __Android:__ Hello, I'm CALM. My human friend here is named Verger.
> 
> __Verger:__ **(incomprehensible grunt)**
>
> __Karla:__ We've just crashed and are looking for parts to fix our ship.
> 
> __CALM:__ No repair is possible on the Dead Planet's Moon. No space jumps are possible. To survive, the only option is to join our underground community. You'll only have to give up all your possessions.
>
> __Samanta:__ You didn't harpoon us here?
>
> __CALM:__ Brecht did it. He's the leader of the Breakers, a group of scavenger bandits.

CALM is obviously malfunctioning. We have no other options than to follow him and his human friend.

> __CALM:__ You'll join the underground community.
>
> __Verger:__ **(incomprehensible approbation)**

## Second scene: The underground community

We are led to an airlock that leads below the bunker. The people in the underground community are very akward. They seem to lack stability on their feet. Tom, with his stump, is well respected by the community for some reason.

A man named **John** stands out and welcomes us. He misses an eye, a leg and breathes in a heavy way. He wears a scrub suit and tells us we are going to be quarantined.

> __John:__ We have to make sure you're not infected by any disease. We have to protect the community. Please put all your belongings in these bags. You'll get them back after seven days.

We comply. 

Each member of the community has to give up a body part for the benefit of the community. John tells Tom that he won't have to give up anything (he seems disappointed).

> __Samantha:__ Do you mean you eat each other?
>
> __John:__ Yes, this is a valiant sacrifice for the community. We are all equal here. I would give up my hands if I could, but I won't be able to help the community anymore without them.

The term"Organ donor" has just taken a whole new meaning... The group decides they will only give up one ear each.

We spend all our time in the medical facility. The meals we are given are strange. After the quarantine, we are welcome in the common hall for a feast.

An old lady in a wheelchair, Malta, is the leader of the community. She has no legs.

> __Malta:__ Today, we celebrate the arrival of our new members. Let's eat!
>
> __Karla:__ What are we eating?
>
> __Malta:__ We are eating the flesh of our brothers and sisters.
>
> __Karla:__ Do you know about hydroponics? We could grow vegetables and eat something else than human flesh.
>
> __Malta:__ This is an interesting idea, this would help our community tremendously. How would you do that?
>
> __Karla:__ We can transfer the hydroponics from our ship to your bunker.
>
> __Malta:__ This is a great idea. We'll do that tomorrow. But tonight, let's feast and 

## Third scene: The facilities

Tom visits the facility while the others are getting their ears cut off. He finds a smelly dorms. He finds a group of old ladies who are knitting with missing fingers.

> __Old lady 1:__ Oh the goats! What fantastic creatures!

Three rooms are not allowed:
- The vault
- The goat farm
- The garden
 
Tom notices a **machine shop** where many machine parts are available, as well as a **facilities** room where many tools and other parts can be found.

## Fourth scene: The second day

Carlton meets a teenage kid with dreadlocks with no missing bodypart. 

> __Dean:__ I want to go to the surface of the Planet of the Dead. It's just a name, it's not really dead, it's a paradise out there. I want to see it.
>
> __Carlton:__ How do you know that?

Dean shares a broadcast with us. A woman name **Victoria Bradley** confesses she has done terrible things in a "forest". She is happy to be on the Planet of the Dead because it's empty and calm. She says they crashed a ship names "Les Sans Culottes".

Overall, Dean is a dysfonctional kid, lost in the madness of this place. He is a bit too enthusiastic about going away from this community.

### Samanta and John

Next, Samanta wants to get more respect from the community by giving us another body part. She wants to earn the respect of John, who suggest to do surgery on a goat as a test.

Samanta completely fails the surgery and the goat dies. John is furious and throws her out of the medical facility.

### Tom, the parts and Malta

A few members of the group go to our ship to determine what repairs are needed. Tom searches the **machine shop** and the **facilities** room for parts.

- *Machine Shop:* Doesn't have the parts we need, but has all the relevant tools.
- *Facilities:* Regarding the survival equipment, there is everything we need.

Tom is informed Malta wants to see him in the Control Room. This room is filled with screens -- the entire community is monitored. A patchwork of portrait is displayed in this room, on glass bottles. Each picture has a risk level attach to it, like "potential troublemaker", "low security risk", "X dates Y", "makes unsettling sculpures", "not a nice person", etc.

> __Malta:__ I need your help. I don't like the way Dean behaves in our community. He is a troublemaker. There is no future outside of our community. If he can't understand that, he has to be taken care of, if you see what I mean.

As far as I can see, every inch of the bunker is monitored. Malta gives me a old rotten candy to thank me.

The garden is accessible from the control room, so Tom goes there, joined by Carlton. He finds a large place with horrific sculptures and attempts at growing plants. Some of them represent parasitism, pain and other disturbing feelings. **_These statues remind us of the one we found in the Alexis_**.
