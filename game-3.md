# Introduction to Mothership Game 3

We've just failed a space jump. We are crashing towards the red moon because a space harpoon was shot at our ship. There's a huge bunker and dozens of other crashed ships on that moon.

## Characters
- Carlton "Cortex" Ortega, the captain
- Samanta Carter, a medic
- Karla Von Linn√©, a biologist
- Tom Tomson, a one-handed marine

## First scene: The crash

The whole group gathers in the cockpit room. Tom is feverish and just had a nightmare. He is in a bad shape, but Samanta Carter tries to help him.

Carlton seals all the doors, but the ship is breached on the oxigen purifier and larder. The damage is substantial, but repairable within a few weeks, if they can get the parts.

## What we do

We decide to go out and explore the moon. We need to find the parts to repair the ship.
